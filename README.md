# speech_recognition_tensorflow
In this demo code we build an LSTM recurrent neural network using the TFLearn high level Tensorflow-based library to train on a labeled dataset of spoken digits. Then we test it on spoken digits. 
  
Dependencies
============
* tflearn (http://tflearn.org/)
* tensorflow  (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html)
* future

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies

Usage
===========

Run the following code in terminal. This will take a couple hours to train fully.

`python demo.py`
